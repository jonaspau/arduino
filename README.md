# Projects for learning arduino programming

This repo is made to store the code required to run through the projects in the Arduino Starter Kit and the Arduino Projects book

[Link to starter kit](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-starter-kit-multi-language)

The projects can be made online with [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) either to mock up the project or if you don't have an arduino.

Rather than using Arduino IDE most projects will most likely be set up with the Platform IO extension in VS code.
